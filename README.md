#feelings about departments at university 

#description
A lot of students makes bad decision for their university department. The project will consider people's thought about their job or departments. Then the program  will make decision which department is good or bad for studing from comments.

#proposal
I am going to collect what people think about jobs or departments. I’m going to use Java to collect data for user. For finding comments and thoughts ı will use forums on internet for example http://www.parlakbirgelecek.com/tr/faydali-bilgiler/universite-secimine-baslarken/hangi-bolum is  good page for analysis. Finally, the program will give us result as "doctor makes a lot of money" is positive or "teachers have issues" is negative.
